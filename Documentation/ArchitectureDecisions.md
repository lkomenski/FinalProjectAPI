## Controller Architecture Consolidation

### Decision: Unified AuthController for All Authentication

**Date Implemented:** November 19, 2025

**Problem:**
- Redundant authentication logic across multiple controllers (LoginController, CustomerController, AuthController)
- Inconsistent authentication patterns between user types
- Duplicate registration and login methods
- Maintenance complexity with scattered authentication code

**Solution:**
Single `AuthController` handles all authentication operations:
- Customer login and registration
- Vendor token-based registration and login
- Admin/Employee login
- Password reset flow
- All BCrypt password operations

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Single source of truth for authentication
- ✅ Consistent security implementation across all user types
- ✅ Easier to maintain and update security practices
- ✅ Reduced code duplication
- ✅ Clear separation: AuthController (authentication) vs other controllers (business logic)

**Controllers Removed:**
- `LoginController.cs` - Completely redundant with AuthController

**Controllers Updated:**
- `CustomerController.cs` - Removed `Login()` and `Register()` methods, kept profile/address management
- `AuthController.cs` - Consolidated all authentication logic

## Vendor Registration Security Model

### Decision: Token-Based Vendor Registration

**Date Implemented:** November 19, 2025

**Problem:**
- Vendors should not self-register like customers
- Need admin approval before vendor accounts are created
- Security risk of unauthorized vendor access

**Solution:**
Two-phase vendor registration:
1. **Admin Phase:** Employee adds vendor business info, generates secure token
2. **Vendor Phase:** Vendor receives token via email, uses it to create login credentials

**Security Features:**
- 48-hour token expiration (TTL)
- One-time use tokens (cleared after registration)
- Token invalidation on regeneration
- Secure modal-based token display (not persistent)
- BCrypt password hashing on account creation

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Admin approval required before vendor account creation
- ✅ Prevents unauthorized vendor registrations
- ✅ Time-limited access prevents stale tokens
- ✅ Secure token transmission via encrypted email
- ✅ Audit trail through DateUpdated fields

**Implementation Files:**
- `SQL Scripts/GenerateVendorRegistrationToken.sql`
- `SQL Scripts/VendorRegister.sql`
- `Controllers/VendorsController.cs`
- `components/TokenModal.js`

## Password Security Implementation

### Decision: BCrypt for All Password Operations

**Date Implemented:** Throughout development

**Why BCrypt:**
- Industry-standard password hashing algorithm
- Automatic salt generation per password
- Configurable work factor (set to 12 for security/performance balance)
- Timing-safe password verification
- Resistant to rainbow table attacks

**Implementation Details:**
- **Package:** BCrypt.Net-Next (latest maintained BCrypt implementation for .NET)
- **Work Factor:** 12 (2^12 = 4,096 iterations)
- **Hash Format:** `$2a$12$...` or `$2b$12$...` (60 characters)
- **Storage:** NVARCHAR(255) fields accommodate BCrypt hashes

**Password Operations:**
- Customer registration: `BCrypt.HashPassword(password)`
- Vendor registration: `BCrypt.HashPassword(password)`
- Login verification: `BCrypt.Verify(plaintextPassword, storedHash)`
- Password changes: Verify old password, hash new password

**Benefits:**
- ✅ No plain text passwords ever stored
- ✅ Each password has unique salt
- ✅ Timing-safe comparison prevents timing attacks
- ✅ Configurable difficulty scales with hardware improvements
- ✅ Industry-proven security

## Database Architecture

### Decision: Dual-Database Design

**Databases:**
1. **MyGuitarShop:** Customer-facing operations (products, orders, customers)
2. **AP (Accounts Payable):** Vendor and invoice management

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Clear separation of concerns
- ✅ Independent scaling (customer traffic vs vendor operations)
- ✅ Security isolation (vendor financial data separate)
- ✅ Different backup/recovery strategies per database
- ✅ Simplified access control per database

### Decision: Stored Procedure-Only Data Access

**Why Stored Procedures:**
- SQL injection prevention through parameterized queries
- Pre-compiled execution plans (performance)
- Centralized business logic in database
- Easier to optimize without code changes
- Clear contract between application and database

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Security: No dynamic SQL in application code
- ✅ Performance: Cached execution plans
- ✅ Maintainability: Database logic separate from application
- ✅ Testability: Can test procedures independently

---

## Frontend Architecture

### Decision: React with Context API

**Why React 19.x:**
- Modern component-based architecture
- Excellent ecosystem and community support
- Performance optimizations with Virtual DOM
- Hooks for cleaner state management

**Why Context API over Redux:**
- Simpler for application scope (cart, user state)
- No additional dependencies needed
- Sufficient for our state management needs
- Less boilerplate than Redux

**Routing:**
- React Router 7.x for declarative routing
- Protected routes based on user roles
- Clean URL structure

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Component reusability
- ✅ Fast development with hot reload
- ✅ Rich testing ecosystem (React Testing Library)
- ✅ Excellent user experience with responsive UI

### Decision: Breadcrumb Navigation

**Date Implemented:** November 19, 2025

**Problem:**
- Users navigating from dashboard to account settings had no way back except browser back button
- Poor UX when deep in application

**Solution:**
- Breadcrumb navigation showing path: Dashboard / Account Settings
- Clickable parent links for easy navigation
- Consistent placement at top of pages

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Improved user orientation
- ✅ Faster navigation
- ✅ Professional UX standard

---

## Repository Pattern Implementation

### Decision: Factory-Based Repository Pattern

**Why Repository Pattern:**
- Abstracts data access away from business logic
- Enables testability through interface mocking
- Supports multiple database providers

**Implementation:**
```
IDataRepository (interface)
  ↓
SqlServerRepository (implementation)
  ↓
DataRepositoryFactory (creates repositories)
  ↓
Controllers (consume via DI)
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Loose coupling between controllers and data access
- ✅ Easy to swap database providers
- ✅ Testable with mock repositories
- ✅ Single responsibility: repositories handle data, controllers handle HTTP

---

## API Design Standards

### Decision: RESTful API Design

**Standards:**
- Resource-based URLs: `/api/products/{id}`
- HTTP verbs: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE
- Standard status codes: 200, 400, 401, 404, 500
- JSON for request/response bodies
- Consistent error response format

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Industry-standard approach
- ✅ Self-documenting API structure
- ✅ Easy integration with frontend
- ✅ Familiar to developers

---

## Security Architecture

### Defense-in-Depth Strategy

**Layers:**
1. **Input Validation:** Client-side and server-side validation
2. **Authentication:** BCrypt password hashing, token expiration
3. **Authorization:** Role-based access control
4. **Data Access:** Parameterized stored procedures only
5. **Output Encoding:** JSON serialization prevents XSS
6. **HTTPS:** Encrypted transmission (production)

**Key Security Decisions:**
- No plain text passwords ever
- No direct SQL queries from application
- Generic error messages (no information leakage)
- Token expiration and one-time use
- Separate admin approval for vendor accounts

---

## Testing Strategy

### Decision: Manual Testing with HTTP Client Files

**Why .http Files:**
- Fast iteration during development
- Works natively with VS Code REST Client extension
- Version controlled with code
- Easy to share with team

**Future Enhancement:**
- Add automated integration tests with xUnit

- Database read replicas for reporting
- Separate databases allow independent scaling

### Future Scaling Options:
- Load balancer for multiple API instances
- Caching layer (Redis)
- Message queue for async operations
- Microservices split by domain (if needed)

---

## Error Handling Strategy

### Consistent Error Responses:
```json
{
  "error": "Error type",
  "message": "User-friendly message",
  "statusCode": 400
}
```

### Error Levels:
- **400:** Client input errors (validation failures)
- **401:** Authentication failures
- **404:** Resource not found
- **500:** Server errors (database, exceptions)

### Security Considerations:
- Generic error messages in production
- Detailed errors only in development
- Never expose database errors to client
- Log detailed errors server-side only

---

## Deployment Architecture

### Development Environment:
- SQL Server Express on localhost
- .NET API on http://localhost:5077
- React dev server on http://localhost:3000

### Production Considerations:
